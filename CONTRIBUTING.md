# Contributing

There is a plan for Scrapper development, but it's still an open source project. Thus, if you have something: you found a bug, want to propose a new feature, or have an interesting observation, feel free to open an issue. We'll discuss it and decide what to do next.

If you're interested in contributing, please, propose your code with a pull request. You can tackle the existing issue, or create new one with your own suggestion. Proposed code should meet Python standards (PEP8, Flake8). Also it'll be good, if you'll use [Black formatter](https://github.com/psf/black) on your files before commiting. Source code docs should be written in [Google style](https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html#example-google). And don't forget to push "Like" on issues, which you want to be implemented faster.

For now there are some QLogic internal mechanisms in Scrapper. It's on a way to universalising them, but if you don't need some code, you're always able to get rid of it locally, or to create a fork of the project.
